            <li>What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</li>
            <p class="ans"><u>Answer:</u> DOM means Document Object Model. We can interact with our document by programming through it. We can change the document structure, style, and content by it. Here the documents are represented as nodes and objects.</p>
            <li>How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</li>
            <p class="ans"><u>Answer:</u> We can select HTML elements by their tag name, class name , Id and also by query selectors.Like: <br><br>
               i. getElementsByTagName()
               <br>
               ii. getElementsByClassName()
               <br>
               iii. getElementById()
               <br>
               iv. querySelector()
               <br>
               v. querySelectorAll()</p>
            <li>What is event bubble?</li>
            <p class="ans"><u>Answer:</u> Event bubbling is like when we wants to do any event, it first triggers on the innermost targeted element, and then it go to upwards. It is a type of DOM event propagation. We can get rid from event bubbling by stopPropagation() method.</p>
            <li>What is a callback function and why will you use it?</li>
            <p class="ans"><u>Answer:</u> When we pass a function as an argument to another function then it became a callback function. When we want a function to execute after the completation of another function on that time we use a callback function.</p>
